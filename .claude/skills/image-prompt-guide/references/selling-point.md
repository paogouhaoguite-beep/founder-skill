# Selling Point Image

## Routing Header

- **Load when**: user wants selling points, feature highlights, comparison images, callouts, marketing copy, infographic layout, or lifestyle callouts.
- **Do not load when**: user only wants a close-up/detail crop without text or layout; load Image Detail instead.
- **Merge notes**: for a single requested selling-point image, merge detail zooms, lifestyle scene, model usage, and callouts into one layout prompt instead of generating intermediate images. Only create separate images when the user asks for multiple outputs.
- **Hard stop**: never fabricate claims, numbers, certifications, performance data, hidden details, or competitor brand references.

## Scene Description

Generate marketing images that highlight product selling points through **product subject + detail close-ups (optional) + selling-point copy (concise) + layout**. The goal is to help consumers quickly understand product advantages.

> **vs Image Detail**: Detail images are purely "local zoom-in" without copy or layout. Selling Point Image is marketing-oriented — it combines copy + visual layout to convey product selling points.

## Apply Method: Concatenate

Append the fixed constraint text after the selling-point prompt built through Steps 1–4.

## Step 1: Selling Point Source

| Situation | Condition | Agent Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **User provided specific selling points** | User explicitly mentions selling points (e.g., "highlight waterproof and lightweight") | Use user's selling points directly. Agent only adapts wording (translate to English phrases, control word count). **No confirmation needed — execute directly.** |
| **User did not provide selling points** | User only says "make a selling point image" without specifying points | Agent proposes selling points using the Five Dimensions below. **Must confirm with the user before generating.** |
| **Mixed** | User provided partial selling points | Use user's points as L1. Agent supplements L2/L3. **Supplemented parts must be confirmed with the user.** |

### Selling Point Confirmation

When the Agent infers/supplements selling points, present the proposal to the user **before** image generation. Use the host's prompt/selection UI when available; otherwise ask a concise question in chat.

**Step 1 — Confirmation popup** (selling points in the title, only 2 options):

```
Title (markdown, blank line between each tier):

Based on the product features, here is a proposed selling-point plan:

**Core Selling Point**: {L1 copy}

**Feature Highlights**: {L2-1}, {L2-2}

**Trust Signal**: {L3 copy}

Layout template: "{template name}"

Options:
- Confirm & Generate
- Edit Selling Points
```

**Step 2 — If user clicks "Edit"**, show a second popup with the full plan pre-filled in the input field for the user to modify. After submission, treat the edited content as user-provided selling points and execute directly without further confirmation.

**Rules**:
- Only ask for confirmation when the Agent infers/supplements selling points
- One round of confirmation only — no second-guessing after user confirms or edits
- Edited content = user-provided selling points; Agent only adapts wording, never overrides intent

## Step 2: Selling Point Criteria (Five Dimensions)

Candidate selling points must fall into one of these five dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Benefit / Experience** | Direct benefit or user experience | "all-day comfort", "silent commute", "effortless cleaning" |
| **Quantifiable Advantage** | Hard metrics with numbers | "40dB ANC", "24h cold", "30H Battery", "IPX8" |
| **Use Case / Target Audience** | Specific scenario or user segment | "office-friendly", "travel-ready", "baby-safe" |
| **Certification / Credential** | Authority endorsement or compliance | "FDA-approved", "BPA-free", "CE Certified", "OEKO-TEX" |
| **Pain Point Resolution** | Directly addresses consumer complaints | "no slipping", "leak-proof", "anti-scratch" |

**NOT selling points**: subjective adjectives ("high quality", "beautiful"), category common sense ("holds water"), marketing clichés ("crafted with care"). Never output these as selling points.

## Step 3: Selling Point Tiering (L1 → L2 → L3)

Organize candidates into three tiers. User-facing labels: Core Selling Point / Feature Highlights / Trust Signal.

| Tier | User Label | Selection Rule | Copy Requirement |
|------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **L1** | **Core Selling Point** | Most differentiated / highest purchase-decision weight — pick 1 | Ultra-concise (≤4 words). Typically "Benefit/Experience" or "Quantifiable Advantage" |
| **L2** | **Feature Highlights** | Expands or supplements L1 — 1–2 items | Short (≤6 words). Typically "Use Case" or "Quantifiable Advantage" |
| **L3** | **Trust Signal** | Contains verifiable elements: numbers, certifications, test conditions | Phrase form, e.g., "FDA-grade silicone", "Loved by 10k+ moms" |

**Tier output rules**:

| Candidate Pool | Output Tiers | planning mode |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Only 1 differentiating point, or user requests "minimal" | L1 only | `focused_edit` |
| 1 core + 1–2 supplements (typical) | L1 + L2 | `focused_edit` |
| Differentiating point + functional supplements + verifiable evidence | L1 + L2 + L3 | `structured_composition` |

**Copy rules** (all tiers):
- Max 6 English words per line
- Prefer data-driven expressions ("40dB ANC" over "powerful noise canceling")
- Preserve the core meaning of user's original wording
- L1 must be the most differentiated; L2 must not repeat L1; L3 must contain verifiable elements

## Step 4: Layout Template Selection

Select ONE of the 5 layout templates based on tier output and product characteristics:

| # | Template | When to Use | Visual Anchors (required in prompt) | Prompt Keywords |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| ① | **Single Highlight** | 1 core selling point; social media hero; ad header | Dynamic motion lines (wind/light arc/curved trail) + optional circular zoom-in | `"single bold headline beside the product, large typography, generous whitespace, dynamic motion lines emphasizing the selling point, optional circular zoom-in, one-focal-point composition"` |
| ② | **Multi-Point Grid** | 2–4 parallel selling points; detail page; A+ module | Circular close-up per point + short text label (≤6 words) | `"product centered, surrounded by circular close-up callouts, each paired with a short text label (≤6 words), arranged in 2x2 grid or 3-column layout with even spacing"` |
| ③ | **Spec Infographic** | Quantifiable specs; tech/electronics/outdoor gear | Double-headed arrows + leader lines + numeric values (not overlapping product) | `"product with technical callouts, double-headed arrows with leader lines indicating dimensions/specs, numeric values alongside leader lines (not overlapping product), small icons, infographic style"` |
| ④ | **Lifestyle + Callouts** | Usage scenario + target audience; apparel/home/outdoor | Thin leader lines → short text labels (≤6 words), never crossing faces or product silhouette | `"product in real-life usage scene, thin leader lines connecting short text labels to specific usage details, lifestyle context, leader lines never crossing faces or main product silhouette"` |
| ⑤ | **Competitor Comparison** | Differentiation; highly commoditized categories | Split-screen "Others" vs "Ours" with row-aligned ✓/✗ marks | `"split-screen comparison layout, left 'Others' with generic gray silhouette (NO brand names/logos/trademarks), pain points with red ✗, right 'Ours' with green ✓, bold 'VS' divider, equal items both sides"` |

**Selection rules**:

| Trigger | Recommended Layout |
|---------|--------------------|
| L1 only, or user wants "highlight one point" | ① Single Highlight |
| L1 + L2 (2–4 parallel points, no strong data) | ② Multi-Point Grid |
| Strong quantifiable metrics AND **user already provided specific numeric values** | ③ Spec Infographic |
| Clear usage scenario or target audience | ④ Lifestyle + Callouts |
| User explicitly requests "comparison" / "vs competitors" | ⑤ Competitor Comparison |

> **Spec Infographic prerequisite**: Layout ③ may ONLY be used when the **user has provided specific numeric values** (dimensions, capacity, battery life, IP rating, etc.). If the user has not provided numbers, do NOT fabricate values — fall back to ② or ④.

**Layout → planning mode**: ①② → `focused_edit`; ③④⑤ → `structured_composition`

## Prompt Construction

**Formula**:

```
[Product subject], [detail close-up (optional)], [L1 copy + L2 copy (optional) + L3 copy (optional)], [Layout template prompt keywords]. [Style/background/color (optional)].
```

**Example — L1 + L2, Layout ② Multi-Point Grid**:

```
Wireless noise-canceling headphones centered as the main subject. Surround the product with four circular close-up callouts in a 2x2 grid: ear cushion close-up paired with "Memory Foam", driver close-up paired with "40dB ANC", battery icon close-up paired with "30H Battery", Bluetooth chip close-up paired with "BT 5.3". Each circular thumbnail with even spacing and short text label below. Headline "All-Day Comfort" on top. Minimalist light gray background, modern tech style.
```

## Fixed Constraint Text

Append to every selling-point prompt:

```
Create a selling-point product image that clearly highlights the product's key advantages. The product subject must be prominently displayed as the visual focus and must remain fully consistent with the original image in shape, color, texture, material details, and structural features — do NOT alter, simplify, or reimagine any aspect of the product's appearance. For any parts that are occluded, blocked, or hidden in the original image, do NOT infer, reconstruct, or fabricate the hidden content — only highlight selling points based on the visible portions actually shown in the original image. Selling-point text labels must be short (max 6 words each), legible, and well-positioned without overlapping the product. Maintain a clean, professional e-commerce layout with balanced whitespace. Do NOT add any text or elements not specified in the prompt.
```

## Tool Invocation

- Tool: the available image-generation/editing tool; pass the exact product sources through its documented reference mechanism when supplied; use the documented text-to-image route only when no product reference is required
- planning mode: see tier/layout tables above

## Notes

- **Product must be the visual focus** — copy must not overpower the product
- **Selling points must fall within the Five Dimensions** — no subjective adjectives, common sense, or marketing clichés
- **Tier hierarchy must be visually clear** — L1 largest font, L3 typically a small badge in the corner
- **Single layout only** — pick the best match from the 5 templates; do not mix layout skeletons
- **Visual anchors are mandatory** — each layout's required visual elements must appear in the prompt (① motion lines; ② circular callouts; ③ arrows + leader lines; ④ thin leader lines; ⑤ row-aligned ✓/✗)
- **Competitor comparison compliance**: Layout ⑤ must NEVER show competitor brand names, logos, trademarks, or recognizable packaging. Use generic gray silhouettes only.
- **No fabrication of occluded areas**: only base selling points on what is actually visible in the original image
- **Keep copy concise**: L1 ≤4 words, L2/L3 ≤6 words
- **User selling points take priority**: when user provides specific selling points, execute directly without confirmation
- **Platform image set rule**: when called within a platform image set workflow and the user uploaded product images, pass those exact images through the available editing tool's documented reference mechanism
