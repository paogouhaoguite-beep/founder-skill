# Image Translation

## Routing Header

- **Load when**: user asks to translate visible image text into another language and expects the image itself to be updated.
- **Do not load when**: user asks to replace only specific same-language text, fix a typo, update a price/date, or add new marketing copy.
- **Merge notes**: translation is usually one call to the available image-editing tool for the full image. Do not split by text region unless tool limitations require it.
- **Hard stop**: if the target language is missing, ask for it before editing. Never answer with text translation only when the user requested an edited image.

## Scene Description

Translate all visible text in the image into the target language and replace the original text directly on the image, producing a translated version that is visually identical to the original except for the text language.

> **Mandatory constraint**: Use the available editing tool to produce the translated image once the target language and source image are available. Do not output translations as text only or ask whether the user wants an image output.

## Apply Method: Direct Apply

Use the prompt template below, replacing `<target_lang>` with the user's specified target language.

## Prompt Template

```
Translate all visible text in the provided image into <target_lang>, and replace all original text with the translated text. The final result must be visually indistinguishable from the original image except for the language change.
Strictly follow these rules:
## Font Matching:
- Match the original text's font, weight, size, color, and kerning as closely as the tool allows.
- Match any perspective distortion, curvature, or warping effects applied to the original characters as closely as possible.
## Background Integrity:
- Preserve the original image background without any changes.
- Do not alter the product or scene's shape, structure, or composition.
## Seamless Integration:
- Ensure the new text blends naturally with the background. No visible edges, cut marks, or color block differences.
- Simulate realistic lighting effects: the new text must cast/receive shadows consistent with the scene's light source.
## Content Accuracy:
- Translations must be grammatically correct and contextually appropriate.
- Do not modify any text outside the target areas.
- No garbled text, spelling errors, or typos allowed.
```

Replace `<target_lang>` with the user's specified target language (e.g., English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, etc.).

## Tool Invocation

- Tool: the available image-generation/editing tool
- planning mode: `focused_edit`

> **Execution rule**: After matching this scene and confirming required inputs and an available editing tool, execute the edit. If the tool is unavailable, report that no translated image was produced and label any translation/prompt as preparation only. When execution is available, the following behaviors are not acceptable:
> 1. Extracting text and outputting translation as text only
> 2. Outputting text translation first, then asking if the user wants an image
> 3. Skipping the tool call and replying with translated text in any form

## Notes

- **Output must be a translated image when image editing is requested** — do not substitute a text-only translation
- The target language must be specified by the user
- Font, weight, size, color, and kerning should closely match the original
- Background must not be altered in any way
- Lighting effects must be consistent with the scene
- Translations must be grammatically correct and contextually appropriate
- Do not modify text outside the target areas
