# Model Showcase

## Routing Header

- **Load when**: user wants a model wearing, holding, or naturally demonstrating the product while preserving the original product photo background.
- **Do not load when**: user asks for model plus a new lifestyle/background scene or marketing copy only; load Scene Image or Selling Point as the primary scene.
- **Merge notes**: model constraints may be combined into Scene Image when the user wants both a model and a new environment. Use Selling Point when the model image also needs callouts or copy.
- **Hard stop**: do not change product identity, product proportions, or introduce unrelated scene elements in the pure Model Showcase flow.

## Scene Description

Generate a high-quality e-commerce model showcase image based on the product photo, with a model naturally demonstrating the product's wear or usage effect. Three variants based on user input.

> **Hard constraint**: This scene **preserves the original product image background**. It only adds a model to the scene.
> - If the user also wants to **change the background** (outdoor, street, home scene) → route to **Scene Image** and include model elements in the prompt
> - If the user wants **selling-point copy/layout/callouts** → route to **Selling Point Image** layout ④ (lifestyle)
> - Only use this scene when the user **just wants to add a model** without background change or marketing copy

## Apply Method: Direct Apply

Select the variant based on priority: A (has reference model photo) > B (specified model type) > C (neither).
